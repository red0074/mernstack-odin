    <h1>LINKS</h1>
    <p>
      Links are one of the key features of HTML. They allow us to link to other
      HTML pages on the web. In fact, this is why itâ€™s called the web.
    </p>
    <h2>Anchor element</h2>
    <p>
      To create a link in HTML, we use the anchor element. An anchor element is
      defined by wrapping the text or another HTML element we want to be a link
      with an "a" tag.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        By default, any text wrapped with an anchor tag without a href attribute
        will look like plain text. If the href attribute is present, the browser
        will give the text a blue color and underline it to signify it is a
        link.
      </li>
      <li>Opening links in a new tab</li>
      <p>
        The method shown above opens links in the same tab as the webpage
        containing them. This is the default behaviour of most browsers and it
        can be changed relatively easily. All we need is another attribute: the
        target attribute.
      </p>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Generally, there are two kinds of links we will create:
        <ol>
          <li>absolute link</li>
    Links to pages on other websites on the internet
          <li>relative link</li>

          Links to pages located on our own websites
        </ol>
    </p>
    <h1>images</h1>
    <p>Websites would be fairly boring if they could only display text. Luckily HTML provides a wide variety of elements for displaying all sorts of different media. The most widely used of these is the image element.</p>
